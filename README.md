### Process Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: The system continuously monitors NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) for near-real-time MODIS/VIIRS hotspot data.

2. **Threat Assessment**:
   - New hotspots are detected and analyzed
   - Intersection with protected Areas of Interest (AOI) is calculated
   - Threat levels are assigned based on proximity to assets
   - Historical fire behavior and weather data are considered

3. **Autonomous Decision Making**:
   - AgentCore processes hotspot data using LLM reasoning
   - Critical threats trigger automated alert workflows
   - ICS (Incident Command System) updates are drafted automatically

4. **Visualization & Mapping**:
   - Live maps are rendered using NASA GIBS WMTS tiles
   - Worldview-style interactive maps show current fire activity
   - Protected areas and assets are overlaid for context

5. **Alert System**:
   - On-call personnel are automatically paged for critical threats
   - Alert fatigue is minimized through intelligent filtering
   - Response teams receive actionable information

6. **Data Storage**:
   - DynamoDB stores incident records, hotspot history, and AOI definitions
   - S3 caches map tiles and stores generated reports
   - Lambda functions buffer and union AOI queries for efficiency

## Key Features

The Wildfire Early-Warning & Triage System provides:

- **Real-time Hotspot Detection**: Continuous monitoring of NASA FIRMS data
- **Intelligent Threat Ranking**: AI-powered assessment of wildfire threats to protected assets
- **Automated Alerting**: Smart notification system with minimal false positives
- **Interactive Mapping**: Live fire maps with protected area overlays
- **ICS Integration**: Automated generation of Incident Command System updates
- **Historical Analysis**: Trend analysis and fire behavior prediction
- **Multi-source Data**: Integration of MODIS, VIIRS, and optional EONET event data

## Demo Metrics

- **Detectionâ†’Notification Latency**: Target <5 minutes from satellite detection to alert
- **Actionable Alerts/Day**: Filtered high-priority alerts requiring human attention
- **False Positive Rate**: <10% of alerts result in no action required
- **Coverage Area**: Configurable AOI monitoring with polygon-based definitions

# Setup Agent Runtime
cd ../agent-runtime
./setup.sh

# Setup Frontend
cd ../frontend
./setup_and_run.sh
```

## Sample Prompts

1. "Show me all active wildfires within 50km of protected areas"
2. "What's the current threat level for the Yellowstone region?"
3. "Generate an ICS-213 update for the latest fire activity"
4. "Create a map showing fire progression over the last 24 hours"
5. "Alert me if any new hotspots appear near critical infrastructure"
6. "What's the confidence level of the fire detection at coordinates 45.123, -110.456?"
